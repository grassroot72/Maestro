    <p>ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set).
       Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.
       UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
       The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8.</p>
    <p>Codes 32-127 are common for all the different variations of the ASCII table,
       they are called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation
       marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols. You will find almost every character
       on your keyboard. Character 127 represents the command DEL.</p>
    <p>There are several different variations of the 8-bit ASCII table.
       The table below is according to Windows-1252 (CP-1252) which is a
       superset of ISO 8859-1, also called ISO Latin-1, in terms of printable
       characters, but differs from the IANA's ISO-8859-1 by using displayable
       characters rather than control characters in the 128 to 159 range.
       Characters that differ from ISO-8859-1 is marked by light blue color.</p>
